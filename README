About SimpleCA

This little tool was implemented back in 2001 by Joris Ballet 


Original code from 2001 can not run in newer Tcl
environment without error and it looks as if it
runs only with OpenSSL up to 0.9.x and but not
1.0.x

SimpleCA
--------

A simple gui solution to manage your x.509 certificates.

SimpleCA implements a simple X.509 CA with a nice GUI. 
You can manage ssl or personal certificates. 

You have no configuration options: 
all is based on sensible defaults (1024bit keys, etc...). 

The basic features are present (generate certificate, 
revoke certificate, export pkcs12, revocation lists).

I am still looking for a public Subversion service, if you know a good one, please drop me a mail. SimpleCA is written in Tcl. Tcl is the best programming/scripting language ever invented.

suggestions: If you want to contact me, or have bugs/ remarks/ suggestions, please email. I do respond on any mail I receive. If you did not receive a response, my SPAM filter caught your mail.
